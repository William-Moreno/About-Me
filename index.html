  <p>My name is William Moreno. My wife, Laurel, and I have two children: A 14 year old boy named Riley and 12 year old girl named Alexis. We have lived in Pacific, Washington for over 18 years. I have always lived in Washington, but I have lived in several different cities throughout my life.</p>

  <p>I have attended many schools over the years with varying levels of success. I graduated from Lakes High School in Lakewood, in 1989. I attended the University of Washington for two years in their engineering program. I attended Pierce College in Lakewood for a couple of years in general studies. I went to Green River from 2003 through 2004 where I focused on forensic science.</p>
  <p>Over the years, I have held many jobs. My first job was working as a cashier/mechanic in a service station. Mostly though, I have worked in manufacturing positions since 1997. I worked for 5 years in aerospace manufacturing for a company called Hexcel, located in Kent. I spent over 15 years working at my last job in trucking manufacturing for a PACCAR company called Dynacraft in Algona (Auburn).</p>
