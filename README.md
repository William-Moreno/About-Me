## About Me, with a guessing game, Extending 'About Me' Page

I build an app to demonstrate my growing grasp of the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The app displays a styled web page that contains some light biographical information about myself and uses JavaScript to greet the user and play a "guessing" game with them about the information on the page utilizing 5 yes or no questions. Next the user is prompted to try to guess a random number in 4 attempts. Then, the user is prompted to try and guess one of my favorite series of books which are located in an array. Finally, the user is informed of their final score for the "game".

### How Does The Application Work

### Reflections and Comments

#### Lab: 02

- It was difficult not to use some of the knowledge of JavaScript functions and loops that I learned about in Code 102 while working on this project
- I wanted the page to load fully before the prompts and alerts started firing off, so I went in search of a manner in which I could accomplish my goal. I found good information that helped me with this at JavaScript.Info _(see link above)_
- I admit I'm not a fan of the particular reset.css file which we are using at this time and I can see why many people tailor these files to their own personal tastes

#### Lab: 03

- For what it does, the JavaScript code in particular looks like a behemoth. It is bloated by commented out console.logs that are essentially the same length as my alerts. I should look to truncate or abbreviate the console.logs to increase readability.
- I am sure that if given enough time, I would find ways to DRY out the code, but the combination of time-pressure and the multiple custom reponses to a variety of questions presents a definite obstacle to this. If I can find time, I will attempt to overcome it.
- I need to work on how I organize my CSS selectors within the styles.css file to make it easier to find elements I have previously selected.
