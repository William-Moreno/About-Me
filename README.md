## About Me, with a guessing game

I build an app to demonstrate my growing grasp of the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The app displays a styled web page that contains some light biographical information about myself and uses JavaScript to greet the user and play a "guessing" game with them about the information on the page utilizing 5 yes or no questions. The user is then informed of their final score following the "game".

### Reflections and Comments

- It was difficult not to use some of the knowledge of JavaScript functions and loops that I learned about in Code 102 while working on this project
- I wanted the page to load fully before the prompts and alerts started firing off, so I went in search of a manner in which I could accomplish my goal. I found good information that helped me with this at JavaScript.Info _(see link above)_
- I admit I'm not a fan of the particular reset.css file which we are using at this time and I can see why many people tailor these files to their own personal tastes
